# Delivery guide
This is a hands-on instructor guided lab. As such the students' instructions don't include a comprehensive discussion of all concepts 
and technologies covered in the lab. It is expected that the instructor will walk students through the steps of the lab and while doing that 
deep dive into the key topics and answer questions as necessary.

The goal of this document is to provide the instructor with hints on what should be covered at each step of the lab.

## Audience
This lab targets developers who may not have an AI/ML background. If there are participants who are new to AI/ML topics, the instructor should introduce key AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts. This repo includes two teaching tools that instructors are free two use:
- A gentle introduction to AI/ML - this is the recommended tool for the lab's target audience
- AI/ML foundations - this is a more formal coverage of AI/ML topics and is recommended to support discussions with data scientists and professional AI developers
