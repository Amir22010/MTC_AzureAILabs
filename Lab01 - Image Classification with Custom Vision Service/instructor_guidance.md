# Delivery guide
This is a hands-on instructor guided lab. As such the students' instructions don't include a comprehensive discussion of all concepts 
and technologies. It is expected that the instructor will walk students through the steps of the lab and while doing that 
deep dive into the key topics and answer questions as necessary.

The goal of this document is to provide the instructor with hints of what should be covered at each step of the lab.
