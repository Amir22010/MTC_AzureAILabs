# Image Classification with Custom Vision Service
In this lab you will train, test, and deploy a custom image classification model using Microsoft Cognitive Services Custom Vision Service. 

The lab is designed as an instructor guided hands-on exercise. The most efficient way to go through the lab is to follow the instructor. In addition to walking you through the lab's steps, she will explain key concepts and dive into technical details that may not be thoroughly documented in the lab's instructions. Don't hesitate to ask questions !

## Scenario

You will train a custom image classification model to automatically classify the type of land shown in aerial images of 224-meter x 224-meter plots. Land use classification models can be used to track urbanization, deforestation, loss of wetlands, and other major environmental trends using periodically collected aerial imagery. The images used in this lab are based on imagery from the U.S. National Land Cover Database. U.S. National Land Cover Database defines six primary classes of land use: *Developed*, *Barren*, *Forested*, *Grassland*, *Shrub*, *Cultivated*. For the sake of simplicity, in this lab we will train a classifier to recognize three classes: *Barren*, *Developed*, *Cultivated*.  Example images in each land use class are shown here:
